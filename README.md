# feup-sope

This repository incorporates the 1st and 2nd project developed for SOPE (Operating Systems) aswell as class exercises.


## Project 1: an implementation of the Unix command 'find'

The first project consisted on implementing our own simplified version of the Unix shell command 'find'.
This was achieved in a recursive way with the creation of multiple child processes.


## Project 2: A multi-threaded 'sauna' management application

The second project consisted on a multi-threaded application to simulate and manage a sauna with multiple clients of different genders arriving with different service times.
