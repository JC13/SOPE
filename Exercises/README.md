-----EXERCISES OF EACH LECTURE-----


This folder contains the exercises made for each lecture exercise sheet.

IMPORTANT NOTES:

- some exercises were only meant to test code or so simple that I did not keep the source code file;
- usually the solution is named "p[exNumber+Item].c". If not, the name should be explicit;
- in order to test each solution you must first compile it using the "gcc" command:
  - if the program uses threads make sure to include "-pthread" as an argument
